# ðŸ§®  Data Integration & Schema Design

Integrating a new dataset into an existing PostgreSQL database. Taking a deeper dive into understanding dataset structure, identifying relevant columns, cleaning messy data, and designing a script-based workflow to load it efficiently.

## ðŸ§  Task Summary

working with a real-world (and purposefully messy) SAT results dataset. Goal is to:

- Inspect and understand the structure of the dataset.
- Select meaningful and relational columns that link to existing tables.
- Identify issues in the data such as duplicates, outliers, or formatting inconsistencies.
- Clean and preprocess the data using Python.
- Prepare the data for database insertion.
- Write a Python script that connects to the database and appends the cleaned data.

By completing this task, youâ€™ll practice translating raw CSV data into relational database entries while thinking critically about schema and data integrity.

## Key Finding
- the cleaned data is saveed as meifang_sat_results.csv
- when replace the missing value, it will be better with a reference, if no reference, just keep it.
